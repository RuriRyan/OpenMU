# Contributions

Contributions are welcome if they meet the following criteria:

* Language is english.

* Code should be StyleCop compliant - this project uses the [StyleCop.Analyzers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StyleCop.Analyzers/)
  for VS2019 so you should see issues directly as warnings.

* Coding style (naming, etc.) and quality should fit to the current state.

* No code copied/converted from the well-known decompiled source of the
  original server.

If you want to contribute, please create a new issue for the feature or bug (if
the issue doesn't exist yet) so we can see who is working on something and can
discuss possible solutions. If it's a small thing, you can also just send a
pull request without adding an issue.

Apart of that, contributions from non-developers are welcome as well. You can
test the server, submit issues or suggestions, packet descriptions or
documentations about the concepts and mechanics of the game itself. Please use
markdown files/syntax for this purpose.

If you have questions about that, don't hesitate to ask in our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/2u5Agkd)
or by submitting an issue.
